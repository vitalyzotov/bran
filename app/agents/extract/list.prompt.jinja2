Context:
~~~
{{ context }}
~~~

Your response should be in the following format:
```
{
    "list": [
       "item 1 strictly as defined in the context",
       "item 2 strictly as defined in the context",
       ...
   ]
}
```

Rules:
- Read the full context carefully and extract the list of items from it.
- Treat nested lists as part of top-level items and simply concatenate them into the parent item.
- Your response must be in {{language}} language.

Any response other than the JSON format will be rejected by the system.
